# USED SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

As a result of its inherent benefits in flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, a Microservices architecture is selected as the best paradigm for the Inventory Management Tracker.

In summary, the incorporation of a Microservices architecture enhances the Inventory Management Tracker's ability to adapt to diverse user needs, scale efficiently, and maintain optimal performance as the application evolves.

***Key Considerations:***

**Flexibility:** The inventory system is divided into smaller, independent services by the microservices design. This layout makes it easier to develop, implement, and scale individual components, giving you the flexibility to adjust to changing inventory management needs.

**Scalability:** The Inventory Management Tracker can scale individual functions in response to demand by dividing the program into independently deployable microservices. This guarantees optimal performance and effective resource allocation, supporting expanding inventory and changing business requirements.

**Maintainability:** The Inventory Management Tracker's generic architecture, made possible by microservices, makes maintenance easier. Because problems and upgrades are limited to particular services, it is simpler to improve, update, and debug individual inventory items without having an impact on the system as a whole. This method increases the system's robustness and endurance by streamlining the maintenance process overall.
